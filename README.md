# Data-Analysis-with-Python-Stanford-Continuing-Studies-CS-65W
This repository contains the final project for the Stanford Continuing Studies course on Data Analysis with Python (CS 65W). The project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),  Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization and the implementation of unsupervised machine learning algorithms on a dataset provided by Kaggle.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to apply data analysis techniques and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to uncover insights and patterns in a real-world dataset. This project demonstrates the skills and concepts learned during the CS 65W course with Matt Harrison.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is courtesy of Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023/data

# Results
All the project is documented within the [Spotify_Data_Analysis.ipynb]((https://github.com/Erick-Lascano/Data-Analysis-with-Python---Stanford-Continuing-Studies-CS-65W/blob/main/Spotify_Data_Analysis.ipynb)) notebook.



# Additional Resources
Don't forget to check out the instructor's book, "Effective Pandas: Patterns for Data Manipulation" by Matt Harrison, for an in-depth guide to data analysis with Python.
